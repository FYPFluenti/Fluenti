## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) 
- **npm** or yarn package manager
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)
- **Python 3.8+** for ML model execution
- **PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121** with CUDA support (recommended)
- **Internet connection** for initial model downloads (7+ GB)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FYPFluenti/Fluenti.git
   cd Fluenti
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Database
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fluenti
   
   # Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   
   # OpenAI (for enhanced AI features)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # AI Model Configuration (REQUIRED for ML features)
   HF_HOME=E:\Fluenti\models\hf_cache
   HF_HUB_DISABLE_TORCH_LOAD_CHECK=1
   PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
   
   # Server
