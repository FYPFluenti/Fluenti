- âœ… AI responds to typed message
- âœ… No audio processing involved

### **Test 3: Debug & Network Monitoring**
1. **Open**: Browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. **Go to**: Network tab
3. **Test voice recording again**
4. **Monitor for**:
   - POST request to `/api/emotional-support`
   - Audio file in request payload
